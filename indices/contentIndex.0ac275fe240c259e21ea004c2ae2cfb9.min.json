I really liked that I can structure my learnings and summaries from my lectures in a way I feel most comfortable with.  Just a few weeks after I started using Obsidian, I thought: \"wouldn't it be great if I could access my Vault remotely from any device?\" So I looked at my options:\n\n1. **Using Obsidian Sync**\n   I saw, that Obsidian is offering a subscription Service for syncing Obsidian vaults to all of your devices. But while that would be a fairly easy way to archive my desired result, I would need Obsidian installed on every device I want to look at my knowledgebase.\n2. **Using Obsidian publish**\n   On the same page is saw that Obsidian is offering a publish service as well. But for me as a software engineer it seemed like wasted money because I was sure it could be archived with resources that a are either free or already available to me.\n3. **Using Quartz**\n   Since I decided i didn't want to spend any money on this I started using git as version control for my knowledge base. This made Obsidian Sync obsolete because I could sync my files between all my machines without any problems. I did however have some problems with git on my phone so I thought that I could use CI/CD to publish my Vault to a website so I could view it from anywhere.\n   Luckily I found a repo which archived mostly what I want: [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) (it is based on Hugo, which I wanted to check out anyways)\n\nBefore I started using Quartz I made a few rules on how I want my vault deployed:\n1. **Fully automated**\n   I do not want to have to compile any markdown files to html files. I just want to commit my changes from Obsidian and want the changes to be automatically deployed to the webpage\n2. **Compatible with my current vault**\n   I do not want to rebuild my current vault to fit a specific format. \n\n## Setup\nSo how is my current setup?\nI followed the setup instructions from Quartz which are already pretty good, but I had a few Problems:\n- I wanted to use git submodules to import the topics from my vault which i think are worth sharing with the public. The deployment process did not work with submodules from scratch but a small adjustment in the `.github/workflows/deploy.yaml` did the trick:\n```yaml\n  ...\n  jobs:\nÂ  deploy:\nÂ  Â  runs-on: ubuntu-20.04\nÂ  Â  steps:\nÂ  Â  Â  - uses: actions/checkout@v2\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  with:\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  fetch-depth: 0\nÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  submodules: recursive\n  ...\n```\n\n- However I still have the problem, that some features like \"Last changed by: \" don't work if the files are in a submodule (feel free to contact me if you have a solution for that!)\n- My current vault does not have `title` attributes in the YAML-frontmatter, so i need a way to automatically add this to the files.\n- I do not tag my files in the YAML-frontmatter so hugo does not recognize them as such.\n\nI did not solve these problems yet but I found some interessting projects which partly adress these Problems\n\nI changes some of these problems by hand to test out the rest of the setup. So i pushed my manual changes and voilÃ : I had a github page ready to go.\nI added a custom domain and quickly personalized hugo and now my knowledge base is available to the public under https://knowledge.vogel.business .\n\nThis blog is made in the same way, just a different vault! (Read the story: [[How this blog was born]])\n\n## Future plans\n- I want to take a look at a [modified version of obsidian-export](https://github.com/brandonkboswell/obsidian-export/tree/title_frontmatter) which can add the filename as title attribute to the yaml-frontmatter. However the author descripted a process which needs to run on the local machine before pushing, so I want to automate that process with Github Actions\n- I need to restructure my vault a litte bit: in the future i include title and tags in the frontmatter and i want to remove the first headline since most renderers use the filename as title","lastmodified":"2023-02-21T17:34:58.113204743Z","tags":null},"/How-this-blog-was-born":{"title":"How this blog was born","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-21T17:34:58.113204743Z","tags":null},"/obsidian":{"title":"","content":"","lastmodified":"2023-02-21T17:34:58.113204743Z","tags":null}}
