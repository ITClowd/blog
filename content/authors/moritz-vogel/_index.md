### Bio
My name is Moritz Vogel. I am currently becoming a Software Developer and I am interested in topics like Clean Code, Software Architecture and UX-Design. I am always trying to improve my code quality. I held a few internal talks about these topics at my current workplace to spread the benefits of clean code.

To free my head in the evenings I have several hobbies like making music and baking. I play the clarinet, drums and electrical bass.
